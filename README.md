## Installation

### Linux and macOS

```
v -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/v-analyzer/v-analyzer/master/install.vsh)"
```

### Windows

```
curl 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/v-analyzer/v-analyzer/master/install.vsh' | %{ v -e $_ }
```

## Building from source

Install dependencies:

```bash
v install
```

You can build debug or release version of the binary.
Debug version will be slower, but faster to compile.

Debug build:

```bash
v build.vsh debug
```

Release build:

```bash
v build.vsh release
```

Binary will be placed in `bin/` folder.

## Setup

Add `bin/` folder to your `$PATH` environment variable to use `v-analyzer`
command inside VS Code and other editors (**preferred**).

Or, you can specify the path to the binary in your VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "v-analyzer.serverPath": "/path/to/v-analyzer/bin/v-analyzer"
}
```

> **Note**
> Restart VS Code after changing the settings or PATH.

## Updating

To update `v-analyzer` to the latest version, run:

```bash
v-analyzer up
```

You can also update to a nightly version:

```bash
v-analyzer up --nightly
```

> **Note**
> In the nightly version you will get the latest changes, but they may not be stable!
