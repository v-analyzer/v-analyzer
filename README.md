Bring IDE features for V programming languages in VS Code, Vim, and other editors.

v-analyzer provides the following features:

- go to definition, type definition
- find all references, document symbol, symbol renaming
- types and documentation on hover
- inlay hints for types and some construction like `or` block
- semantic syntax highlighting
- formatting
- signature help

## Installation

### Linux and macOS

```
v -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/v-analyzer/v-analyzer/main/install.vsh)"
```

### Windows
The install.vsh file is downloaded to the current directory and stored there temporarily.
So make sure that there is no file with this name or that it is safe when it is
overwritten or deleted.
#### Powershell

```
curl -o install.vsh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/v-analyzer/v-analyzer/main/install.vsh; v run install.vsh; del install.vsh
```

#### Command shell

```
curl -o install.vsh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/v-analyzer/v-analyzer/main/install.vsh && v run install.vsh && del install.vsh
```


## Pre-built binaries

You can download pre-built binaries from the
[release page](https://github.com/v-analyzer/v-analyzer/releases).
Currently, we provide binaries for Linux (x64), macOS (x64 and ARM), and Windows (x64).

## Building from source

> **Note**
> If you're using Windows, then you need GCC for any build, as TCC doesn't work
> due to some issues.

Update V to the latest version:

```bash
v up
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
v install
```

You can build debug or release version of the binary.
Debug version will be slower, but faster to compile.

Debug build:

```bash
v build.vsh debug
```

Release build:

```bash
v build.vsh release
```

Binary will be placed in `bin/` folder.

## Setup

Add `bin/` folder to your `$PATH` environment variable to use `v-analyzer`
command inside VS Code and other editors (**preferred**).

Or, you can specify the path to the binary in your VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "v-analyzer.serverPath": "/path/to/v-analyzer/bin/v-analyzer"
}
```

> **Note**
> Restart VS Code after changing the settings or PATH.

### Config

v-analyzer is configured using global or local config.
The global config is located in `~/.config/v-analyzer/config.toml`, changing it will affect all
projects.

A local config can be created with the `v-analyzer init` command at the root of the project.
Once created, it will be in `./.v-analyzer/config.toml`.
Each setting in the config has a detailed description.

Pay attention to the `custom_vroot` setting, if v-analyzer cannot find where V was installed, then
you will need to specify the path to it manually in this field.

## Updating

To update `v-analyzer` to the latest version, run:

```bash
v-analyzer up
```

You can also update to a nightly version:

```bash
v-analyzer up --nightly
```

> **Note**
> In the nightly version you will get the latest changes, but they may not be stable!

## VS Code extension

This repository also contains the source code for the VS Code extension in the
[`editors/code`](https://github.com/v-analyzer/v-analyzer/tree/main/editors/code)
folder.
See also extension page in
[VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VOSCA.vscode-v-analyzer).

## NVIM LSP

For Neovim users, v-analyzer is available via [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md#v_analyzer).
It is part of the mason registry and can be installated with `:LspInstall v_analyzer`.
